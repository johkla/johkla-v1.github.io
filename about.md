## but first ...

just for the record, here is the text from the old about page :

<small>i live and work near utrecht in the netherlands and in melbourne australia — and on the internet.
i am a writer, a narrative therapist and a [postatheist](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-qnSdjorlKf_FZ__BwOmUAl-_9OlGpRefKDnjsUDPPk) spiritual carer... </small>

<small>i am a provisional spiritual care training supervisor at the [peter mccallum cancer centre](https://www.petermac.org/).</small>

<small>i wrote a [book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RrVl_iYWO2gyPWlI6Nygl3Lpi0UuKfW3oYQDluI2huo/edit) called *i am here*, about which chris kraus said : *It’s beautifully written, incredibly moving and lingering … terrible, ordinary, tragic.*</small>

<small>in various former lives i was an artist, an academic, and in london in 1977 i was a member of a punk band called [the violators](https://punk77.co.uk/groups/violators.htm) and we shared the stage with such luminaries as xtc, siouxie and the banshees, squeeze and alternative tv. </small>

<small>for now my work is having conversations with people about life and death, about being and mattering and what matters and what it means to be or not to be. although this is most definitely work it’s not how i 'make a living'. i do this work for free, although i do gratefully accept [donations](https://www.paypal.me/johannesk) to offset the costs of living and travel.</small>

<small>i am interested in the im/possibility of becoming posthuman.</small>

## and now ...

but now i am seriously considering not having 'i am a therapist' anymore. there is a nice word in dutch 'medemens' which literally is 'withhuman', the least worst translation would be 'fellow human' ... 

## writing

i wrote a book called i am here.

## supervision

i am a pro
