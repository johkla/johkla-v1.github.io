# github pages

being a bear of little brain i've had one miserable attempt at using github pages/jekyll some years ago but when i came across this little guide ... i decided to have another go

and lo...

one major omission in the guide is the fact that the changes you make to your files are not necessarily immediately reflected in your site. this is serious drawback of using gihub pages but is it possible that you could get used to it?


----------------------

but how to change the footer, for example?  
well...

  1. On GitHub, navigate to your theme's source repository. For example, the source repository for Minima is [https://github.com/jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

  2. In the __layouts_ folder, navigate to your theme's _default.html_ file.

  3. Copy the contents of the file.

  4. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

  5. Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information about publishing sources, see "[About GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)."

  6. Create a file called __layouts/default.html_.

  7. Paste the default layout content you copied earlier.

  8. Customize the layout as you'd like.
