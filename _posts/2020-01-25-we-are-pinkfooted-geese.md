# we are pinkfooted geese

we are pinkfooted geese  
sleeping out on estuaries   
and lochs — we come in   
at sunrise in flocks  
to feed in the fields.

The legendary soprano Galli-Curci was a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda who was the first Indian guru to come to the west in the early part of the last century. I don't have much interest in his method per sé but he had a pretty neat trick. He would ask :  
> Do you smoke?  
> — Yes.  
> Well you can keep smoking.  
> Do you drink?  
> — Yes.  
> Well you can keep drinking... but be prepared that if you follow my teachings your desire to smoke and drink might disappear.   

Ha ha ha. Brilliant.
